The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are clusters of blocks within the same census tract. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tracts. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, tabulation blocks numbered 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within census tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. BGs coded 0 are intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. Block groups generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people. A BG usually covers a contiguous area but never crosses county or census tract boundaries. They may, however, cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. The BG boundaries in this release are those that were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2020 Census.</srcDesc><srcCitatn xmlns=""><resTitle>TIGER/Line Shapefile, 2020,  state, Connecticut, Current Block Group State-based</resTitle><date><pubDate>2020-01-01T00:00:00</pubDate></date><citRespParty><rpOrgName>U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division, Spatial Data Collection and Products Branch</rpOrgName><rpCntInfo><cntAddress addressType="both"><delPoint>4600 Silver Hill Road, Stop 7400</delPoint><city>Washington, DC</city><postCode>20233-7400</postCode><eMailAdd>geo.geography@census.gov</eMailAdd><country>US</country></cntAddress><cntPhone><voiceNum>301-763-1128</voiceNum></cntPhone></rpCntInfo></citRespParty></srcCitatn><srcCitatn xmlns=""><resTitle>TIGER/Line Shapefile, 2020,  state, Massachusetts, Current Block Group State-based</resTitle><date><pubDate>2020-01-01T00:00:00</pubDate></date><citRespParty><rpOrgName>U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division, Spatial Data Collection and Products Branch</rpOrgName><rpCntInfo><cntAddress addressType="both"><delPoint>4600 Silver Hill Road, Stop 7400</delPoint><city>Washington, DC</city><postCode>20233-7400</postCode><eMailAdd>geo.geography@census.gov</eMailAdd><country>US</country></cntAddress><cntPhone><voiceNum>301-763-1128</voiceNum></cntPhone></rpCntInfo><displayName>U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division, Spatial Data Collection and Products Branch</displayName></citRespParty></srcCitatn><srcCitatn xmlns=""><resTitle>TIGER/Line Shapefile, 2020,  state, Rhode Island, Current Block Group State-based</resTitle><date><pubDate>2020-01-01T00:00:00</pubDate></date><citRespParty><rpOrgName>U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division, Spatial Data Collection and Products Branch</rpOrgName><rpCntInfo><cntAddress addressType="both"><delPoint>4600 Silver Hill Road, Stop 7400</delPoint><city>Washington, DC</city><postCode>20233-7400</postCode><eMailAdd>geo.geography@census.gov</eMailAdd><country>US</country></cntAddress><cntPhone><voiceNum>301-763-1128</voiceNum></cntPhone></rpCntInfo><displayName>U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division, Spatial Data Collection and Products Branch</displayName><displayName>U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division, Spatial Data Collection and Products Branch</displayName></citRespParty></srcCitatn></dataSource><dataSource xmlns="" type=""><srcDesc>The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a comprehensive aggregated collection of hydrologic unit data consistent with the national criteria for delineation and resolution. It defines the areal extent of surface water drainage to a point except in coastal or lake front areas where there could be multiple outlets as stated by the "Federal Standards and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) Standard" (https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/11/a3/). Watershed boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. This dataset represents the hydrologic unit boundaries to the 12-digit (6th level) for the entire United States. Some areas may also include additional subdivisions representing the 14- and 16-digit hydrologic unit (HU). At a minimum, the HUs are delineated at 1:24,000-scale in the conterminous United States, 1:25,000-scale in Hawaii, Pacific basin and the Caribbean, and 1:63,360-scale in Alaska, meeting the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Higher resolution boundaries are being developed where partners and data exist and will be incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications. The HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit. WBD line attributes contain the highest level of hydrologic unit for each boundary, line source information and flow modifications.</srcDesc><srcCitatn><resTitle>USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) for 2-digit Hydrologic Unit - 01 (published 20230306) Shapefile</resTitle><date><pubDate>2023-03-06T00:00:00</pubDate></date><citRespParty><rpOrgName>U.S. Geological Survey, National Geospatial Technical Operations Center</rpOrgName><rpCntInfo><cntAddress addressType="postal"><delPoint>U.S. Geological Survey, National Geospatial Technical Operations Center, P.O.

This dataset represents the watershed boundaries for the three estuaries, i.e., the areal extent of surface water drainage to the three estuaries, based on topographic, hydrologic, and other relevant landscape characteristics. The boundaries of the Narragansett Bay and the Southwest Coastal Ponds watersheds are sourced from the U.S. Geological Survey Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) which contains a nested, hierarchical system of hydrologic units. The boundaries of the Little Narragansett Bay watershed were constructed by combining WBD hydrologic unit boundaries for the Wood-Pawcatuck with an NBEP-delineated watershed area for the western portion of Little Narragansett Bay (which comprised a smaller outlet than any hydrologic unit available in the WBD). Watershed boundaries were updated with NBEP’s estuarine coastline delineation (for details about NBEP’s coastline delineation, see metadata for BAYS_NBEP2019). This dataset is intended for use in general planning, GIS analysis, and mapping at watershed and subwatershed scales.

# EJmap_prep
Supplements [EJScreen](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen) data with additional datasets and calculates state and study area 
level percentiles. Outputs shapefile and csv files that can be used for [EJMap](https://github.com/NBEP/EJmap).

# How To Use
Standard users should run ejmap_step1 and ejmap_step2. 

NBEP staff should run ejmap_step1, ejmap_step1b_NBEP, ejmap_step2, and ejmap_step2b_NBEP. 

## Prerequisites
These scripts use python 3.7, ArcGIS Pro 3.1.0, and ArcGIS Spatial Analyst.

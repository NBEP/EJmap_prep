# EJmap_prep
Supplements [EJScreen](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen) data with additional datasets and calculates state and study area 
level percentiles. Outputs shapefile and csv files that can be used for NBEP's EJmap (pending summer 2023).

# How To Use
These scripts use python 3.7, ArcGIS Pro 3.1.0, and ArcGIS Spatial Analyst. Scripts should be run in the following
order: ejmap_step1 (optional), ejmap_step2, ejmap_step3_NBEP (NBEP only).

## ejmap_step1.py
Adds town, watershed, and study area values to block group data. 

### Datasets
- [US Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html)
- [USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/access-national-hydrography-products)

## ejmap_step2.py
Combines multiple datasets and calculates state and study area level percentiles.

### Datasets
- [EPA EJScreen](https://gaftp.epa.gov/EJSCREEN/) 
  - Download csv of state percentiles that does NOT end in _tracts
- [CDC PLACES](https://www.cdc.gov/places/index.html)

## ejmap_step3_NBEP.py
Clips data to NBEP towns, adds metadata, and generates a simplified map for display purposes.
